* `let x=0;` at end of function screws up return type.
* 0; at end of function causes assertion (INT_ANY unresolved to backend)
* for loop
* do while loop
* return
* switch
* passing arrays by value
* structs
* bool type
* function pointers
* int + &T
* &T - &T
* enforce constness
* escape chars in strings lead to wrong type length calculation
* should check for invalid assignment to temporaries in frontend - but only
  backend knows about temporaryness...
* declaration in if (if (var x = blah) {)

missing operators:
  ++, -- (but maybe not)
  sizeof
