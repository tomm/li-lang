* poor int literal inference is annoying
* for loop
* do while loop
* return
* switch
* passing arrays by value
* structs
* bool type
* int + &T
* &T - &T
* enforce constness
* escape chars in strings lead to wrong type length calculation

missing operators:
  /
  %
  ++, -- (but maybe not)

  *=
  /=
  %=
  <<=
  >>=
  &=
  ^=
  |=
  sizeof
